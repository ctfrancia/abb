# Getting Started
- `npm i` or `yarn` depending on your package manager
- while in `server` folder: `$ touch .env` to make sure you have an env file
- while in the `server` folder: `yarn run start:watch` or `npm run start:watch` to start the server

# Roadmap
1. Add typescript to Front-End
2. Add Tests
3. Add authentication middleware to back-end
4. Add errorhandling middleware
5. Add db in leiu of a json mock
6. Add better checking in controller for if nothing is returned

### Comments
1. This challenge was difficult because it's difficult to convert a front end test to a full stack when there is no clear plan or direction as to what the desired outcome is.
I spent so much time just trying to figure out how to convert this into a full stack challenge and incorporate a back end when there is no set path or instructions provided ex: input output. So I just guessed.
2. The vocabulary and introduction is confusing.
